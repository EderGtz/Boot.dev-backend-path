## Projects

[AI Agent CLI in Python](https://github.com/EderGtz/LLM-Agent): Autonomous terminal tool powered by the Gemini API. It uses a reasoning loop to navigate the file system, and execute commands. Features include security guardrails, state management, and robust argument parsing.

[Asteroids on Pygame](https://github.com/Aceitunitaking25/Asteroids_on_pygame) : Classic arcade game built using Python, Pygame, and Object-Oriented Programming principles (Inheritance & State Management).

[Bookbot](https://github.com/Aceitunitaking25/bookbot) : Command-line tool (CLI) for static text analysis. It parses books to generate reports on word count and character frequency.

[Webflyx](https://github.com/Aceitunitaking25/Webflyx) : Streaming app simulation focused on mastering Git workflows, version control, and branching strategies.
